An American astronomer who made contributions to the fields of *extragalactic
astronomy* and *observational cosmology*. He discovered that we live in a
universe of many galaxies that are separated by large distances. He also
discovered *Hubble's law* (independently with **Georges Lema√Ætre**) that
observes that galaxies are moving away from the earth.
