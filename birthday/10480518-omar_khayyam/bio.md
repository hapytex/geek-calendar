A Persian mathematician and astronomer. He designed the *Jalali calendar* based
on very accurate observations of the length of a year. This calendar has eight
leap days every 33 years. He also showed that one can use the intersection of
*conic sections* to yield geometric solutions to *cubic equations*.
