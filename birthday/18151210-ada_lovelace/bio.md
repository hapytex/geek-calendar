An English mathematician and writer. She corresponded with **Charles Babbage**
about his *mechanical general-purpose computer* and was probably one of the
first to recognize its full potential. She is therefore often seen as one of the
first *computer programmers*. One of the first (hypothetical) programs she wrote
was one to compute *Bernoulli numbers*.
