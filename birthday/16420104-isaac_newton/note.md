*Isaac Newton* was born, according to the *Julian calendar*, on December 25, 1642. If we use the modern *Gregorian calendar* and calculate back, then Newton was born on January 4. On December 25 however, some geeks celebrate *Grav-Mass*, an alternative to *Christmas*, to celebrate the scientist that discovered gravity and mass.
