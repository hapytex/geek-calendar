English Physicist **James Chadwich** discovered the *neutron* in 1932. **Enrico Fermi** studied what happened if uranium was bombarded with neutrons and created new elements with these experiments. These experiments were repeated and eventually they found out that this could create barium. **Otto Hahn** suggested that these experiments *bursted the nucleus*, although he was unsure of the physical basis of this. Eventually **Niels Bohr** read about this discovery and visited *Columbia University*. The scientists at *Columbia University* wanted to detect if energy was released when bombarding uranium with neutrons. In the *Pupin Hall*, on february 25, 1932 they set up an experiment with an *ionization chamber*. The tests confirmed that fission was happening, especially for the 235 isotope of uranium.
