In *Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince* the *Weasley*s organized a birthday party for *Harry Potter*
on July 31. At that moment Harry turns 16 and the novel covers the 1996-1997 school year, so that means
*Harry Potter* was born on July 31, 1980.

This is also the birthday of **J. K. Rowling**, the author of the *Harry Potter* series.
